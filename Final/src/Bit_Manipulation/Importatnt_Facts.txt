The AND Operator only results true when both operands are True unless it reults false
The OR Operator only results false when both operands are False unless it results True
The XOR operands produces 1 as output only if there are odd number of ones else produce 0 if there are even number of ones. XOR of same numbers is 0 and XOR with zero produces the same number

** REmember the fact that if there is a number num and its predecessor num-1 then there bit representation will look like:
num-1 will have the first set bit of num as 0 and all bits after it as 1
for example 16 = 10000   then 15 = 01111
in general , if num = 1010100 then num-1 will be num-1 = 1010011
