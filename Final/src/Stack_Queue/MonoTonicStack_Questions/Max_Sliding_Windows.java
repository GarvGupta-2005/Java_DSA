// We initially keep a left and right pointer to fix our window to a size of k. We compute the maximum element present in this window using the

// loop. For every new window we encounter, we add the maximum element using the GetMax function to our data structure.

    //But this is not  good as TC is O(n-k)*k as we have to travese till n-k windows and then look for max in  window;

    //The optimised Approach is as follows
    // We address this problem with the help of a data structure that keeps checking whether the incoming element is larger than the already 
    // present elements. This could be implemented with the help of a de-queue. When shifting our window, we push the new element in from the 
    // rear of our de-queue. Following is a sample representation of our dequeue
    // Every time before entering a new element, we first need to check whether the element present at the front is out of bounds of our 
    // present window size. If so, we need to pop that out. Also, we need to check from the rear that the element present is smaller than the 
    // incoming element. If yes, thereâ€™s no point storing them and hence we pop them out. Finally, the element present at the front would be 
    // our largest element.

    //Note: we can only generate windows till n-k indices where k is size of window as after this the window will exceed the array
